# A Complete Forth System for the SHARP PC-E500(S)

![PC-E500S](PC-E500S.jpeg)

The PC-E500 is a powerful pocket computer introduced in 1989 that saw a [PC-E500S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_PC-E500S) successor in 1995.

SÃ©bastien Furic's original (incomplete) ANS Forth compiler is available from the great retro web site [Aldweb](https://www.aldweb.com/articles.php?lng=en&pg=9362).

I've rewritten large parts of the code to optimize for speed, code size and compliance with standard Forth 2012, see the [changelog](changelog.md). The `docol` fetch-execute cycle is 40% more efficient.  Words are now case-insensitive and can be typed in upper/lower/mixed case.  All standard floating point words are now also included.  Included in this repo are the binaries for unexpanded 32KB machines and expanded >96KB machines.  Also included is the XASM assembler written by N. Kon for the SC62015 CPU with the documentation translated to English.  XASM is required to rebuild the Forth500 system from assembly.  The [Forth500.s](Forth500.s) source code is heavily documented and PC-E500 technical [resources](resources) are included.

## Instruction manual

See the [Forth500 User Guide](manual.md) with an introduction to standard Forth and a full description of the Forth500 system.

## How fast is it?

The [n-queens benchmark](https://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/articles.cgi?read=700) is solved in 4.15 seconds, the fastest Forth system in this benchmark and faster than the compiled n-queens C program on a Sharp PC-G850VS that runs at 8.0MHz compared to the 2.3MHz PC-E500(S).

## Load Forth500 via serial or cassette interface

To use Forth500, first load the binary, then `CALL &B0000` (see [expanded E500](E500-expanded)) or `CALL &B9000` (see [unexpanded E500](E500-unexpanded)).  Forth500 starts immediately and can be exited with `BYE`.  Call again to continue using Forth500 where you left off.  Forth500 resides in protected memory and does not interfere with BASIC.

Forth programs can be loaded into Forth500 via the serial interface or cassette interface with [PocketTools](https://www.peil-partner.de/ifhe.de/sharp/).
