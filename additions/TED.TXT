TED - a Text EDitor
===================

TED is a small text editor for Forth500.

    TED             edit the last file edited
    TED FILE.FTH    edit FILE.FTH
    TEDI            edit the last file edited, then read it into Forth500
    TEDI FILE.FTH   edit FILE.FTH, then read it into Forth500

The TEDI command uses INCLUDE (or INCLUDED) to read the saved file.

You can specify a drive letter, such as E: with the specified file to edit.

The default last file edited is WORKFILE.FTH when TED was loaded.

If a binary file is edited, then all control characters in the range $00 to $1f
except CR ($0d) and LF ($0a) are replaced by a space.  A lone CR is replaced by
LF.  LF and CRLF in the file are kept unchanged.

When the PC-E500(S) is turned off you can press [ON] again to continue editing.

Never press [ON] while editing, since this will quit TED and break to the Forth
prompt.  If that happens, type TED-RESUME or TEDI-RESUME to continue editing
the file.  When breaking to the Forth prompt the file edited is not yet saved.
Executing TED again will revert all changes and load an old version.

Key assignments
---------------

[SPACE]         insert new line before the current line, then start editing
[ENTER]         insert new line after the current line, then start editing
[DEL]           cut line and save it in the buffer
[STO]           copy line to the buffer
[ANS]/[RCL]     paste line from the buffer
[UP]/[DN]       scroll up/down to view lines
[LFT]/[RGT]     edit the top line from the end or the start
[MENU]          menu
[CCE]           exit and save the file
[OFF]           power off and continue later where you left off with [ON]

When editing a line, you can use the cursor keys to freely navigate the line
but not beyond the line.  [INS] switches to insertion mode and back to replace
mode.  [DEL] and [BS] delete characters and [CCE] clears the line.  [ENTER]
returns to the file editor and the cursor disappears.

[MENU] displays the filename, the file size in bytes, and an overview of the
keys.  You can edit the file name with [LFT]/[RGT] then press [ENTER] to return
to the editor or press [CCE] to exit and save the file.

Hints
-----

To start your Forth definitions use ANEW _marker_ with a marker of your choice.
This will automatically remove the old definitions with the new definitions
when you reload the file from disk, for example with TEDI.

To list .FTH files: FILES *.FTH

To rename a file: S" FILE1.FTH" S" FILE2.FTH" RENAME-FILE THROW
