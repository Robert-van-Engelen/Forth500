CALENDAR.FTH adapted from Jupiter ACE <http://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk/listing_Calendar.html> in public domain.

All other Forth source code included here is part of Forth500 and released under the BSD-3.

The `DEBUGGER.FTH` program is legacy code modified to run with Forth500.  It may work, but no guarantees.
